File editing is open to everyone wants to add a new hospital helipad.

Make sure to know what you are doing. Wrong edits will corrupt the file.

Tip for the editors: Add your custom helipads at the beginning of the file, the line after after the very first (and most left) bracket "["
Add lines in this format (you may copy and paste and edit if you like):
[
    48.9620408,
    14.4626536,
    "",
    "Nemocnice České Budějovice"
  ],

  Latitude and longitude must be numerical (google maps format) and latitude on first line, longitude on second line.

  Make sure to respect brackets and commas.
