File editing is open to everyone who wants to add a new hospital helipad.

Make sure to know what you are doing. Wrong edits will corrupt the file.

Tip for the editors: Add your custom helipads at the beginning of the file, the line after after the very first (and most left) bracket "["
Add lines in this format:
  [
    48.2188903,
    16.4634503,
    "Donauspital / SMZ-Ost",
    "Klinik Donaustadt"
  ],


  Latitude and longitude must be numerical (google maps format) and latitude on first line, longitude on second line.

  Make sure to respect brackets and commas.
